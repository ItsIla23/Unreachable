Unreachable is an arcade game built in Unity. The primary goal of the game is to keep the tightrope walker balanced for as long as possible while walking on the rope. The player needs to click on the left or right side of the screen to shift the tightrope walker's weight accordingly. The longer the player can maintain balance, the more distance they will cover and the higher their score will be.

Features

Intuitive Controls: Click on the left side of the screen to shift weight to the left and on the right side to shift weight to the right.
Real-Time Scoring: Display of current score and distance covered in real-time.
Gradual Difficulty: The difficulty increases as the player progresses, as maintaining balance becomes more difficult due to the gusts of wind.
